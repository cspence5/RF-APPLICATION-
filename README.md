# RF-APPLICATION-
Application for RF(Radio Frequency) gun thats used to scan barcodes in warehouse and retail facilities for processing 


This is an example application for a warehouse RF Gun. It reprints labels after scanning the barcode of a box or carton. 
Through the menu the user is allowed to select the type of label printed. The front end is a linux shell script with wrapper while the backend is  a pl/sql application that processes and manipulates the data via an oracle database. 
This is typical of the heavy database work
that is done in Warhouse Software Development. Enjoy!
